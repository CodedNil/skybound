atmosphere:
Auroras and stars https://www.shadertoy.com/view/XtGGRt
Best simple atmosphere with sunsets https://www.shadertoy.com/view/msXXDS https://www.shadertoy.com/view/XdK3zy https://www.shadertoy.com/view/slyBDG
Clouds with sunsets and auroras/stars at night https://www.shadertoy.com/view/cdlyWr

too bright at night
set the sun_dir correctly in the cpu side, blended into going straight up with aur color


froxels:
pass lights emission
do trails from fast animal motion as spheres that get placed on it's path with velocity on them, they fade after a while, include this as an position offset var in the froxels
colour the sky and pass that through as ambient colour, distance fog so they fade out
simple froxel shadowing, so i can do larger scale shadowing
cpu side clouds_sample.rs which is a replica of the clouds density equation so i can do raymarches on cpu, from light source to froxel cell for example

have layers of clouds, define them in a const array, each has a height so there can be thin layers and different layer variables, each also has a different wind direction (though probably shouldn't drastically switch, slow rotations)
could maybe do simple shadowing using the layers above with very coarse read at a single depth of it, then offset with light direction
vary the layers each with a perlin noise heightmap, each has a different offset so sometimes layers can overlap
add a horizon curve by slightly reducing sampled altitude the further horizontally away from camera

fade out clouds with distance
use bluenoise texture instead of maths
rainbows on clouds with the proper equation
cumulonimbus clouds, huge with anvils, use worley noise to position them as separate objects


do the world rendering:
better pole rendering, huge beams of twisting light, where they exit the atmosphere its like a big burst outwards, but it keeps going past that as an infinite beam
blend into the clouds


aur fog:
give fog shadows from the clouds
bad lighting at night, lighting is green at night
make it wildly more turbulent around the lightning flashes


misc:
atmosphere simulation with the world as icosphere nodes, where the wind flows between based on temperature gradients, humidity etc, the nodes could place things like water geysers etc
aur particles in air going up, wind speed based on height going to poles, maybe clouds at lower levels move upwards then across, changing shapes as they go
patterns of stars, basically a tapestry of the universes history created by the gods
