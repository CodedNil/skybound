render at half res then upscale
use bluenoise texture instead of maths

use froxels with low resolution to send simple representations of lights or other data

do trails from fast animal motion as spheres that get placed on it's path with velocity on them, they fade after a while, include this as an position offset var in the froxels

cloud lighting:
needs one more large scale noise, many times bigger than current, to drastically distort the clouds, or maybe alter the existing and make the noise var change the scale of small noise rather than intensity
proper self shadowing, potentially included as a data point in froxels for strong shadows - could give clouds a shadow shape shifted by the sun
cloud colours, white-black and potentially also blue-purple edges
add aur light from below with a blue tint, then normal sun
need a variable that properly breaks them up

cumulonimbus clouds, huge with anvils

do the world rendering:
track latitude and longitude, latitude is basically just z, longitude grows faster the closer to the poles to simulate sphere
renders poles as huge infinite beams going up, give them sunsets at 90 degrees
atmosphere simulation with the world as icosphere nodes, where the wind flows between based on temperature gradients, humidity etc, the nodes could place things like water geysers etc

aur particles in air going up, wind speed based on height going to poles, maybe clouds at lower levels move upwards then across, changing shapes as they go


in the stars are patterns, basically a tapestry of the universes history created by the gods
