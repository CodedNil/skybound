clean up and simplify clouds.wgsl
softer brighter clouds that blend into the atmosphere better, give them fluffy soft edges
variable sky shading on clouds, perhaps update atmosphere.sky every x meters?

make clouds always moving in the wind towards the poles, getting faster as approaching the poles and also denser
much less dense, mostly upper atmosphere clouds on the equator

improve aur light glow, make it part of the atmospheric fog

atmosphere:
Clouds with sunsets and auroras/stars at night https://www.shadertoy.com/view/cdlyWr
https://godotshaders.com/shader/rayleigh-mie-ozone-based-atmospheric-scatter/
sky goes far too red at night, and it snaps between the two suns sharply
planet cutout is too harsh for sky
sunsets look meh


froxels:
pass lights emission, raymarched so it passes through volumes nicely
do trails from fast animal motion as spheres that get placed on it's path with velocity on them, they fade after a while, include this as an position offset var in the froxels

rainbows on clouds with the proper equation
cumulonimbus clouds, huge with anvils, use worley noise to position them as separate objects
try to blend between cirrus, cirrocumulus, altocumulus etc


world rendering:
better pole rendering, huge beams of twisting light, where they exit the atmosphere its like a big burst outwards, but it keeps going past that as an infinite beam
auroras and stars https://www.shadertoy.com/view/XtGGRt
patterns of stars, basically a tapestry of the universes history created by the gods
atmosphere simulation with the world as icosphere nodes, where the wind flows between based on temperature gradients, humidity etc, the nodes could place things like water geysers etc
aur particles in air going up, wind speed based on height going to poles, maybe clouds at lower levels move upwards then across, changing shapes as they go


aur fog:
make it wildly more turbulent around the lightning flashes, make actual bolts of lightning flash out of them
water like caustics on the light that gets emitted up to make it look special


long term:
implement intel xess for performance wins
switch to wesl
